A portfolio site that is built with React

## Description

A portfolio site for Matt Tingley at Black Cat Solutions. This site is built using React and demonstrates the use of the React-Router-Dom and Bootstrap for React. This application is a single page application that features a standard header with a brand and navigation controlled by the React-Router-Dom and a footer that contains three social media components that link to the social media websites of the user. The main section displays the various elements selected in the navigation. The homepage is the About Me section which features a profile photo and paragraph about the individual. A portfolio page that shows six projects of the user with an overlay link to the deployed application and Github repository. A contact me page that features a form with validation that allows someone to reachout to the individual. And finally, a resume page that highlights some of the technologies used by the individual and a link to get a downloadable pdf document of the individual's resume. This site also integrates the use of Font Awesome for React to render brand logos such as Instagram, Linkedin, and Github.
